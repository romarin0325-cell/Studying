All employees hosting nonemployees must follow the steps below. \n \n1) Pre-registration (Required) \n \nA host must register each visitor using the Visitor Portal. \n \nRegistration must be completed by 3:00 p.m. at least one business day before the visit. \n \nVisitors who are not pre-registered may experience delays and may be asked to reschedule. \n \n2) Check-in and Identification \n \nVisitors must check in at the Lobby Visitor Desk. \n \nA government-issued photo ID is required to receive a badge. \n \nThe visitor badge must be worn visibly at all times. \n \n3) Escort and Access Areas \n \nVisitors may wait in the lobby seating area only. \n \nAccess beyond the lobby requires a host escort. \n \nVisitors are not permitted in employee-only areas (mailroom, storage rooms, or IT work areas). \n \n4) Vendor and Catering Deliveries \n \nDelivery personnel must enter through the Loading Dock (South Entrance). \n \nIf a delivery requires access beyond the lobby, the employee who arranged the delivery must meet the vendor and escort them as needed. \n \nFor large deliveries (carts or multiple boxes), hosts should schedule a loading dock window in advance. \n \n5) Parking Passes (Limited Availability) \n \nVisitor parking is limited and is not guaranteed. \n \nHosts may request parking passes through Facilities two business days in advance. \n \nThank you for helping us maintain a safe and efficient workplace. \n \nDocument 2: E-mail \n \nSubject: Visitor access for March 5 client workshop \nFrom: Mina Park <mpark@riversidetower.com \n> \nTo: Jordan Lee <jlee@riversidetower.com \n> \nDate: February 26, 2026 \n \nHi Jordan, \n \nI’m hosting a client workshop for Northwind Analytics on Thursday, March 5 from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. in Training Room 14B. We expect 18 attendees, plus one presenter. \n \nI saw the new notice about visitor access. A few questions: \n \nIf all guests go directly to the training room, do I still need to meet them in the lobby? \n \nWe’re planning to have breakfast delivered around 9:00 a.m. Can the catering company bring it up to the 14th floor? \n \nTwo guests asked about parking—do we have a way to reserve spots? \n \nThanks, \nMina \n \nSubject: Re: Visitor access for March 5 client workshop \nFrom: Jordan Lee <jlee@riversidetower.com \n> \nTo: Mina Park <mpark@riversidetower.com \n> \nDate: February 26, 2026 \n \nHi Mina, \n \nYes—please plan to meet your guests in the lobby. Even if they’re heading straight to a training room, visitors need to check in and must be escorted beyond the lobby. \n \nTo keep things smooth, please do the following by Tuesday, March 3: \n \nSubmit the full names of all attendees through the Visitor Portal (including the presenter). \n \nRemind guests to bring a government-issued photo ID. \n \nSend me the catering company name and estimated arrival time. \n \nFor the breakfast delivery: vendors must use the South Entrance loading dock. If they need to access the 14th floor, someone from your team will need to meet them at the dock and escort them upstairs. \n \nRegarding parking: we can request a small number of passes, but availability is limited. If you want to try, send the names of the two guests who asked today and I’ll submit the request to Facilities. \n \nBest, \nJordan \n \nQuestions"

I am writing regarding your order (No. WS-18427) for 24 units of the MX-900 wireless keyboards, which was scheduled to ship on February 18. \n \nUnfortunately, our carrier has informed us that severe weather conditions in the Kansai region have temporarily disrupted outbound freight operations. As a result, the shipment has been delayed, and the revised estimated delivery date is now February 26. We understand that this may cause inconvenience, (1) _______ if the items are needed for an upcoming installation or an employee onboarding schedule. [1] \n \nTo minimize the impact on your operations, we can offer two alternatives. First, we can send 24 units of the MX-880 model, which is currently in stock and can be dispatched today. The MX-880 has the same layout and compatibility as the MX-900, (2) _______ it does include the dedicated shortcut keys for video conferencing. If this option works for you, we will apply a 10% discount to reflect the difference in features. [2] \n \nSecond, if you prefer to keep the MX-900 model, we can arrange partial delivery: 10 units will be shipped from our Tokyo warehouse immediately, and the remaining 14 units will follow once the freight restrictions are lifted. Please note that this split shipment would require two separate tracking numbers and may arrive (3) _______ different days. In addition, the second shipment may be handed off to a different local carrier depending on route availability. [3] \n \nPlease let us know which option you would like to choose by 2 p.m. tomorrow, so we can update the order and confirm the shipping arrangement. We apologize again for the delay and appreciate your patience. [4] \n \nSincerely, \nHiro Tanaka \nCustomer Support Representative \nWexford Office Supply"

Before we process payment, I noticed a couple of issues that don’t match our purchase documentation. \n \nQuantity: Our PO EV-4479 is for 12 AT-4 chairs, but the invoice shows 14. \n \nService charge: The quote you provided (Quote Q-7741) stated that assembly would be waived because this order is for our new training center opening. However, the invoice includes an Assembly & Placement Service fee of $180.00. \n \nCould you please send a revised invoice reflecting: \n \n12 chairs at the agreed unit price, and \n \nremoval of the assembly fee \n \nWe run our payment batch early next week, so receiving the corrected invoice by Monday, March 16 would help us avoid delaying payment. \n \nAlso, please confirm whether the freight charge will remain the same after the adjustments. \n \nThank you, \nOlivia Chen \nAccounts Payable | Eastview Consulting Group \n \nSubject: Re: Discrepancy on Invoice HP-260310-184 (PO EV-4479) \nFrom: Mark Rivera <mark.rivera@harborprint.com \n> \nTo: Olivia Chen <olivia.chen@eastviewcg.com \n> \nDate: March 12, 2026 \n \nHi Olivia, \n \nThank you for catching that—sorry about the confusion. \n \nYou are correct: PO EV-4479 is for 12 chairs, and the assembly charge should not have been included. I’ll issue a revised invoice today that updates the quantity to 12 and removes the service line. \n \nThe freight charge will remain unchanged, since it’s based on the delivery appointment and handling requirements rather than the chair count. \n \nPlease disregard Invoice HP-260310-184 once you receive the revised version. If you need the updated invoice to reference the original PO and quote number on your side, I can add those details to the notes section. \n \nBest regards, \nMark Rivera \nSales Coordinator | HarborPrint Solutions \n \nQuestions"

Assembly/placement services are excluded, so the $160.00 service fee is correct. \n \nThe chairs are currently back-ordered, which is why the order is split. We can’t guarantee arrival by May 20 for the chairs. If the later delivery won’t work, you may cancel the chair line item before it ships. \n \nRegarding Rewards points: points are earned on the discounted merchandise subtotal only (excluding service fees, shipping, and tax). Points post after shipments go out. \n \nPlease let us know if you’d like to cancel the chair line. \n \nKind regards, \nMetroDesk Support Team \n \nQuestions"

Since the launch, we have received several questions about receipt uploads, approval timing, and the status notifications employees receive after submitting a claim. Your input will help us identify which steps are clear and which steps require additional guidance or system improvements. [1] \n \nThe survey consists of 10 questions and should take no more than five minutes to complete. It covers topics such as how easy it was to locate the correct expense category, whether the mobile upload function worked as expected, and how quickly you received a decision from your approver. Please answer as honestly as possible—even if you have not submitted many claims yet—so that we can understand a wide range of experiences across departments. [2] \n \nTo participate, click the survey link below and submit your responses (1) _______ 5 p.m. on Friday, February 27. The link will remain active until the deadline, but responses received after that time may not be included in the first review report. We plan to share a brief summary of the results with department managers in early March, along with any immediate changes we can implement. [3] \n \nSurvey link: (Internal Portal → Finance → Expense Feedback) \n \nIf you experienced a technical problem—for example, you could not attach a receipt or the page froze while loading—please include a short description in the final comment box. You may also attach a screenshot. Our support team will review these reports separately (2) _______ the survey responses, since technical issues often require direct follow-up. Your input will be used to (3) _______ future updates to the reimbursement guidelines. [4] \n \nThank you in advance for your time and cooperation. If you have questions about the survey, contact Finance Operations at financeops@company.example \n. \n \nSincerely, \nFinance Operations"

Please print the label, attach it to the package, and drop the parcel off at any Yamato Transport location. If you no longer have the original box, you may use another sturdy box, as long as the item is (1) _______ packed to prevent damage in transit.

You can check the status in your online account under “My Orders.” We will issue the refund to your original payment method (credit card) within 3–5 business days after we receive and inspect the returned item. (2) _______ you paid using a debit card, the posting time may depend on your bank’s processing schedule.
